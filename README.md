# LindoMbatha-My-Website-2021-Version
This is an updated version of the website I created for college in 2019.
This took longer than expected, mainly because of external events but nonetheless here it is.
Disclaimer: This is not a real functioning website. It's just a website I created in college for a project and updated just to refresh my skills in HTML and CSS.
Also while updating this website, I realised I need to learn more Java. Finally plans are in the works to make a real functioning website with a friend but only once I have learnt the necessary skills.

The things I updated:
1. The background colour
2. The navigation bar
3. The content
4. Made the buttons work
5. The font
6. Added submittion page

And that's everything so far.
I do plan on updating it at some point again as I feel the website is only good and not great yet, but not right now as I have other projects to do.
